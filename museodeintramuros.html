          <h2>Welcome to Museo De Intramuros</h2>
          <p>
            The Museo de Intramuros comprises two important reconstructions: the San Ignacio Church and the Mission House of the Society of Jesus. As the name denotes, the complex now houses the vast ecclesiastical collection of the Intramuros Administration            </p>
          <span>
            <p>
                First built in 1878 by the Society of Jesus and completed in 1889, the San Ignacio Church, according to contemporaries, was said to be one of the most beautiful in old Manila. Miller (1906), who called it the “jewel of Intramuros,” described its interior as “ravishingly beautiful,” Kemlein (1908) stated that “the charming splendor of this church will never fail to make the deepest impression upon the visitor,” while O’Reilly (1940) wrote that “nowhere in the Islands will more excellent wood carvings be found than here.” The church was the masterpiece of old Manila’s greatest artists. Don Felix Roxas, reputedly the most famous architect of the day, designed the structure, while grandmasters such as Isabelo Tampinco, Crispulo Hocson, Agustin Saez, and Manuel Flores (wood-works), Francisco Rodoreda (marble-works), and Hilario Sunico (metal-works) painstakingly decorated the interior and exterior of the building.  

                It was, however, was destroyed during the Second World War, and its surviving ruins was adaptively reused as a commercial office building. Its acquisition by the government through the Intramuros Administration in 1981 marked a renewed period of possibility. The reconstruction of the church was the goal, and this vision was realized in 2013 when the first cornerstones for the reconstruction was laid. The project signals not just an important step in the development of Intramuros as a monument to the Hispanic era of Philippine history as it is also an important milestone in the promotion of the country’s rich ecclesiastical heritage.                  </p>
