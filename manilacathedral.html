          <h2>Welcome to Manila Cathedral</h2>
          <p>The Cathedral of Manila is the most prominent Roman Catholic church in the Philippines. The Manila Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica is the seat of the Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Manila. It is located in the Plaza de Roma in the historic district of Intramuros. In 1521, Spanish missionaries brought Catholicism to the Philippines and the western style of the church building. The Manila Cathedral is one of the most important and beautiful churches constructed by the Spanish. Manila Cathedral, which dates all the way back to 1581, is a paragon of durability and sturdiness. Although it has been severely damaged by fire, earthquake, and World War II, the cathedral nevertheless survives as a major historical landmark. The cathedral's unique and complicated interiors boast one of the 
            largest pipe organs and other remarkable features, while the Bronze Panel provides insights into the building's past. </p>
           <span><p>
            Manila Cathedral was constructed in either the Romanesque Revival or Neo-Romanesque architectural styles. Check out the features it is best known for - its stunning dome, stained glass windows, and ornate paintings and mosaics. - Because of the massive damage sustained in 1945, some of the cathedral's stunning walls have been rebuilt. The current building's elaborate front is a carbon copy of the seventh church that stood where this one does. The statues and busts currently decorating the area are duplicates of the originals. The originals were crafted from molave wood, but the current versions are carved from Roman travertine stone. - Get a chance to view the huge organ that features 4,500 pipes. It was built in the Netherlands. - 
            The bells in the bell tower are the largest bell activity in the Philippines, weighing in at roughly 17 metric tonnes.
